### Hi there, I am Yongchuan Cui (崔永川) !

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at **[University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院大学)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)** and **[Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院空天信息创新研究院)](http://english.aircas.cas.cn/)**, where I am fortunate to be supervised by **[Prof. Peng Liu (刘鹏)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5wOjyo4AAAAJ)**(*Senior Member, IEEE*). Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree from **[School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)](https://en.cug.edu.cn/)**, where I laid the foundation for my academic journey.

My research interests span across ***computer vision, remote sensing image processing, AI4EO, etc.***, and I am actively seeking opportunities for a **Ph.D.** position to further deepen my expertise and contribute to the field. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions to complex problems and collaborating with like-minded researchers to push the boundaries of knowledge.

If you are interested in my work or have any opportunities that align with my research interests, feel free to reach out! I am always open to new collaborations and discussions.
